# OpenGL-Paint

This project is made with Glitter: https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter

Install glitter and replace the main.cpp and place frag/vert shaders inside the glitter folder and make sure to change reference to the shader file's location 
in the main.cpp file.

This is an attempt to get ping-pong buffering to work, as to create a basic paint shader, where the user can draw with a mouse. This is the particular
shader I'm trying to port currently: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lfczf

This simple set up leads is the first step in achieving rather complex rendering texhniques such as 2D fluid solving and diffusion.
