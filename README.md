# OpenGL-Paint

This project is made with Glitter: https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter

Follow the guide above to install glitter (you also need to D/L cmake command line tools) and replace the main.cpp and place frag/vert shaders inside the glitter folder and make sure to change reference to the shader file's location in the main.cpp file.

This is an attempt to get ping-pong buffering to work, as to create a basic paint shader, and allows user to draw on a canvas with a mouse. This is the particular
shader I've ported currently: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3lfczf

This simple set up is the first step in achieving rather complex rendering texhniques such as 2D fluid solving and diffusion.

This project is currently almost finsihed. Ping-pong buffering is realised properly. If you would like to help out I'd be more than grateful, as I'm a hobbyiest with no formal education in computer graphics, I've just been following along with tutorials from: https://learnopengl.com/ and if you're interested in OpenGL I would recommend The Cherno's videos on the subject: https://youtu.be/W3gAzLwfIP0

License is do as you feel.
